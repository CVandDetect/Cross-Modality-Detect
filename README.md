## Abstract
Cross-modality can integrate complementary information from different modalities to effectively improve the reliability and robustness of object detection. However, compared to processing unimodal inputs, cross-modality significantly increases the computational complexity of the model, which leads to huge memory consumption. In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight Cross-Modality Hybrid Encoder (CHE) that maintains low computational consumption while enhancing the performance of the detection model, which includes two modules designed by us: the Attention-based Cross-Modality Feature Interaction (ACFI) module for feature interaction within and between modalities, and the Res-CNN-based Cross-Modality Feature Fusion (RCFF) module for feature association and enhancement. Our method is tested on LLVIP, FLIR, and M3FD datasets. The experiments demonstrates a good performance. 
 Our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on mAP with 2.6\% on LLVIP, 1.1\% on FLIR, and 0.4\% on M3FD datasets. Additionally, our method requires only 79.7M parameters, significantly fewer than the 244.6M parameters of the SOTA method Fusion-Mamba, while maintaining high accuracy. This work represents the first exploration of DETR’s potential for cross-modality fusion.
